# Challenge Elements

## Description
Welcome to my very first challenge for the Coding Bootcamp Certificate course through Michigan State University. Beginning with a starter code, I updated the HTML elements to meet the acceptance criteria. 

## The Challenge
### User Story
    AS A marketing agency
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
### Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Learning Points
Being a beginner coder, this challenge helped better my understanding of HTML elements, attributes, and overall structure. 

## Credits
W3Schools helped identify different semantic elements used in HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
